# The new CYB website

## cyb.no + in.cyb.no

CYB has previously had a separate volunteer system and website, both of which were maintained by the IT group (previously X-group). After the old volunteer system unfortunately stopped being maintained and (eventually) stop functioning, CYB lost access to tools for logging volunteer hours, tracking the stock in Escape, and managing membership. 

After a grueling semester of google sheets and paper logs, we have finally gotten the new system live! Previously the volunteer system and the main CYB website have been separate, but in an attempt to make the main website more appealing, the two have been merged into a single resource.

## Tech stack

This is more or less the tools used to create the website.

## How to run a dev instance

Coming soon.

A dev-database and environment file are being developed so that volunteers in the IT-group may test features locally.

Experimental features are available at [dev.cyb.no](https://dev.cyb.no)
